I saw: 
- the filtered output of 3 differents software: mutect (SNVs), breakdancerMax (SVs), SCoNEs (CNVs)
- The 3 files show 3 different formats (vcf, tsv sv, tsv cnv)
- almost all type of variant are represented here: mutations, insertions, deletion, inversion, translocation, large amplification and deletion (CNVs)
